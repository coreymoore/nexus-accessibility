      This page lists and explains the focus-related alerts used in this
      extension, based on the

    <div class="alert-section" id="tabindex">
      <span class="alert-anchor">Tabindex Alert</span>
      <div class="alert-desc">
        Indicates that the element has a <code>tabindex</code> attribute, which
        affects its focusability and tab order. <br />
        <strong>Details:</strong> Elements with <code>tabindex="-1"</code> are
        not tabbable but can be focused programmatically. Elements with
        <code>tabindex="0"</code> are tabbable in document order. Positive
        values set a custom tab order, which can be confusing for keyboard
        users.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-section" id="not-tabbable">
      <span class="alert-anchor">Not Tabbable Alert</span>
      <div class="alert-desc">
        Indicates that the element is not tabbable, meaning it cannot be reached
        using the Tab key. This may be due to <code>tabindex="-1"</code>, being
        hidden, or other reasons.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-section" id="aria-hidden">
      <span class="alert-anchor">ARIA Hidden Alert</span>
      <div class="alert-desc">
        Indicates that the element or one of its ancestors has
        <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>, which removes it from the accessibility
        tree and prevents screen readers from interacting with it.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-section" id="invisible">
      <span class="alert-anchor">Invisible Element Alert</span>
      <div class="alert-desc">
        Indicates that the element is visually hidden (e.g.,
        <code>display:none</code>, <code>visibility:hidden</code>, or
        <code>opacity:0</code>), which may affect its focusability and
        accessibility.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-section" id="disabled">
      <span class="alert-anchor">Disabled Element Alert</span>
      <div class="alert-desc">
        Indicates that the element is disabled (e.g.,
        <code>disabled</code> attribute on form controls), making it unfocusable
        and unusable for keyboard users.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-section" id="role-presentation">
      <span class="alert-anchor">Role Presentation Alert</span>
      <div class="alert-desc">
        Indicates that the element has <code>role="presentation"</code> or
        <code>role="none"</code>, which removes its semantic meaning from the
        accessibility tree and may affect its focusability.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-section" id="focus-event">
      <span class="alert-anchor">Focus Event Alert</span>
      <div class="alert-desc">
        Indicates that the element has JavaScript event handlers related to
        focus (e.g., <code>onfocus</code>, <code>onblur</code>), which may
        affect its behavior when focused.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-section" id="autofocus">
      <span class="alert-anchor">Autofocus Alert</span>
      <div class="alert-desc">
        Indicates that the element has the <code>autofocus</code> attribute,
        which causes it to receive focus automatically when the page loads.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-section" id="focusable-descendant">
      <span class="alert-anchor">Focusable Descendant Alert</span>
      <div class="alert-desc">
        Indicates that the element contains a descendant that is focusable,
        which may affect navigation and accessibility.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="alert-section" id="custom-focusable">
      <span class="alert-anchor">Custom Focusable Alert</span>
      <div class="alert-desc">
        Indicates that the element is made focusable through custom scripting or
        ARIA attributes, rather than native HTML properties.
      </div>
    </div>
