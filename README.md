# Nexus Accessibility Testing Toolkit

A Chrome extension for real-time accessibility inspection and testing. This toolkit provides developers and QA teams with instant feedback about accessibility properties, ARIA attributes, and screen reader output of any focused element.

This is an early release and not feature complete. Some accessibility properties do not properly display. This is a known issue and will be resolved before official release.

## Features

## Shadow DOM Support and Limitations

- For elements inside Shadow DOM, Access Nexus uses ARIA attributes and native properties to estimate accessible name, role, and description.
- This may not match the computed accessibility tree shown in Chrome DevTools, and may miss browser-internal accessibility calculations.
- For elements in the main document, full accessibility info is retrieved using the Chrome Debugger Protocol.
- Due to Chromeâ€™s architecture, extensions cannot access the full computed accessibility tree for shadow DOM elements.
